I needed a place to keep my thoughts on what I am learning, reading and doing as a grad student in the QMSS program at Columbia University, and I thought a blog would be a good place for it all. I’m afraid there isn’t more to this first post; this is really just me, enjoying the view, after climbing up a small hill called inertia. More to come.

(A hearty thanks to Moacir P. de Sá Pereira, Research Data Librarian at Columbia University Libraries for helping me getting this up and running!)
