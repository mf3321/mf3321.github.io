<p>Introductions are a good place to begin. In fact, I can offer a selectionâ€”a 3-paragraph summary, a 2-sentence summary, a 15-word summary and a 6-word summaryâ€”since we had to complete an assignment doing just that.</p>
<p>The easiest to write was the 3-paragraph summary. Three paragraphs provides quite a bit of canvas to paint a picture of yourself, with the broad brush and the fine. Hereâ€™s what I wrote:
<blockquote>I'm a part-time MA student in the QMSS program at Columbia University on the data science track. I absolutely love what Iâ€™m learning and Iâ€™m enthusiastic about using my new skills to help our society answer the toughest questions. Having studied economics as an undergraduate, I see those questions as those of choice: what are our options, how do we make the right decisions, who gets to decide.
Data science will be my third career. My first was translation. I worked for over a decade as a professional translator with a roster of clients that included major cultural and economic institutions and companies across the globe. I was named to the French courtsâ€™ official lists of sworn translators, and continue to hold certification in the United States (15% pass rate). My current career is administration. Iâ€™m Executive Assistant and Special Projects Manager in the Deanâ€™s Office of Columbia College. Iâ€™ve acquired a broad range of responsibilities supporting College leadership on high visibility, high-value projects, with a track record that makes me an in-demand asset among leadershipâ€™s lieutenants.
I am a driven and hardworking professional who has a reputation for rigorous quality in all that I do. I am looking to leverage my problem-solving skills and varied experience by transitioning into the field of data.</blockquote></p>
<p>The hardest to write was the 6-word summary. Six words gets you the barest of descriptions. Hereâ€™s what I wrote:
<blockquote>Future data science writer and researcher</blockquote></p>
<p>If I had just a few words more, I would have written:
<blockquote>Researcher and writer seeking to put data to good use</blockquote>
I wasnâ€™t really thrilled about either of them, but couldnâ€™t think of anything better at the time.</p>
<p>The 15-word summary provides just enough space to include additional ideals or details:
<blockquote>Current data science grad student at Columbia University. Analytical thinker, stylish writer, project management pro.</blockquote></p>
<p>The 2-sentence summary offers the space to say what you need to say, and be a little creative about it. 
<blockquote>Future data scientist, assembled with high-performance parts from prior careers requiring stylish writing, analytical thinking and remarkable efficiency. Fueled by an enthusiasm to do good and the determination to succeed. (Launching in May 2024.)</blockquote>
I donâ€™t know what inspired me to use car imagery since I am not a car person. What I wanted to do was to speak to my past career and highlight the skills that I believe are highly transferable.</p>
<p>By this time, Iâ€™d completed the assignment, and felt I could have a little fun with it. After writing the car-inspired summary, I wrote this:
<blockquote>100% data burger made with pure Python patty sandwiched between an academically rigorous bun. Topped off with crisp writing, finely efficient project management, and a slice of creativity.</blockquote>
â€¦which shortened to this: 
<blockquote>Exciting combo deal with high-value skills in data, research, writing and project management</blockquote>
â€¦and ended with this:
<blockquote>Great Value Combo with Money-Back Guarantee</blockquote>
<p>Who would turn that offer down?! Perhaps I should do some A/B testing to see what works best! ðŸ˜‰</p>
