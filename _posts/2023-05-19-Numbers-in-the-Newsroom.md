<p>Numbers In The Newsroom: Using Math And Statistics In News</p>
<p>One of the sessions I attended at <a href="https://mf3321.github.io/2023/03/24/Open-Data-Week-2023-and-NYC-School-of-Data-2023.html">NYC School of Data 2023</a> was led by reporters at <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/">The City</a>. The panel discussion was moderated by Scott Klein, Chief Product Officer, and included Suhail Bhat, Data Reporter, Sam Rabiyah, News Apps Developer, and independent journalist Anjali Tsui. The variety of data sources discussed mirrored the diversity of stories covered by The City’s reporters.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the session, an audience member asked whether there are style guides that data journalists use; the two resources cited were <a href="https://www.ire.org/product/numbers-in-the-newsroom-using-math-and-statistics-in-news-second-edition-e-version/">Numbers in the Newsroom: Using Math and Statistics in News</a> by Sara Cohen and <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780742510883/Precision-Journalism-A-Reporters-Introduction-to-Social-Science-Methods-Fourth-Edition">Precision Journalism: A Reporter’s Introduction to Social Science Methods</a>, by Philip Meyer. I’m the sort who takes book recommendations seriously, so I picked up both copies from the University library shortly after. Neither are recent books–Cohen’s book published in 2001 and Meyer’s book was first published in 1973–but both are still worthwhile reads, for different reasons.</p>
<p>In Numbers in the Newsroom, Cohen’s primary purpose seems to be to calm the fears of journalists reporting with numbers. “We often ask too much of numbers, and that’s why we’re uncomfortable with them.” Given how much numbers permeate all areas of our lives, and not just the work of journalists, such fears, if expressed today, would be mildly alarming. Yet Cohen’s advice remains relevant because it promotes a healthy skepticism of numbers and discourages a blind, unthinking use of numbers: “A number is an opinion. It’s just hidden behind scientific-sounding methods and carries an air of authority. Some opinions carry the credibility of years of impartial study. Others don’t. A number is a summary. Some numbers help paint accurate portraits of the living, breathing world the number represents. Others don’t. A number is a guess… Some guesses are close enough to being right to use without warning. Others aren’t.”</p>
<p>Cohen also offers a list of 7 tips for reporters “to keep their copy number-free and fair”: 1) keep the number of digits in a paragraph below eight; 2) memorize some common numbers on your beat; 3) round off–a lot; 4) learn to think in ratios; 5) use devices from everyday life; 6) envision your dream number and calculate it if it isn't given to you; 7) learn from one another. Obviously, the seven tips for reporters do not translate exactly as tips for data scientists (who are certainly not trying to keep their “copy” number-free), but they do serve as a reminder that their results should first pass a gut-check, that readability and ease of comprehension are important, that colleagues are an important resource.</p>
<p>Cohen’s final piece of advice does translate exactly for data scientists, and relates to the statistician’s judgment of statistical significance. Cohen writes, “significance tests help you figure out if you’re focusing on something that seems like a big difference, but is actually quite possible because of dumb luck. ‘Significant,’ however, doesn’t mean ‘meaningful’ or ‘newsworthy.’ All it means is, ‘How often would a difference like this happen by chance alone?’ And given the numbers reporters deal with, it will usually come out statistically significant, even if it’s meaningless.” A sobering reminder for all data scientists.</p>
