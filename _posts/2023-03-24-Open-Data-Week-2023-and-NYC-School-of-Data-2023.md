<p>Last week was Open Data Week 2023, a 7-day festival of events celebrating New York City’s open data. Events were both online and IRL, and included introductions to the city’s open data portal; presentations by city agencies on their unique datasets; hands-on workshops by companies and nonprofits using open data to deliver services to New Yorkers; and even a data-inspired art exhibit. The festival closed with an all-day conference NYC School of Data hosted at CUNY Law School.
This was my first Open Data Week so I really did not know what to expect. I found the online events to be interesting and engaging, so I decided to register for NYC School of Data and it did not disappoint. From the entire week’s worth of events, here are just a few things I particularly enjoyed: the quiet enthusiasm of Open Data Ambassador Natarajan Krishnaswami, the entire D×D Hidden in Plain Sight exhibit, the team task set out by US Census Bureau’s David Kraiker. Actually, I was a little surprised by how much I enjoyed everything; even the sessions that I feared might be dry (the Mayor’s Management Report) were great. Kudos to the organizers and all the speakers and participants! I’m looking forward to next year!
