<p>A few observations from using ChatGPT on the writing assignment.</p>
<p><b>ChatGPT is very good at summarizing information</b></p>
<p>ChatGPT is built from the entire internet.<sup>1</sup> It’s therefore no surprise that the chatbot is great at summarizing. My primary source texts were well written and easy to read so they did not represent a high hurdle for me in completing <a href="https://mf3321.github.io/2023/08/11/ChatGPT-on-My-Mind-part-3.html">my assignment</a>. But I can see how this tool would be excellent for less straightforward, more difficult texts.</p>
<p><b>ChatGPT is great at drafting an outline</b></p>
<p>Answers seem to be provided in a 5-paragraph essay format by default. No lopsided structural organization here!
<p><b>ChatGPT is highly sensitive</b></p>
<p>One of my initial prompts had been “Describe 3 challenges facing the industry of higher education”. ChatGPT generated answers that more accurately answered the question, What does the public consider the 3 major problems in higher education. I changed one word in my prompt, which was sufficient to redirect the output. In fact, the opening paragraphs for each answer underscored the difference in perspective that ChatGPT was arguing.</p>
<p><ul>Prompt: <i>Describe 3 challenges facing the industry of higher education.</i></ul></p>
<p><ul>Introductory paragraph: <i>The higher education industry faces several challenges that impact institutions, students, and society as a whole. Here are three significant challenges:”</i></ul></p>
<p><ul>Prompt: <i>Describe 3 challenges facing the business of higher education.</i></ul></p>
<p><ul>Introductory paragraph: <i>“The business of higher education, which encompasses the financial and operational aspects of universities and colleges, faces several unique challenges. Here are three significant ones:”</i></ul></p>
<p><b>ChatGPT works with general information, general arguments</b></p>
<p>While the answers were factually correct and could be expressed, when prompted, in a sophisticated manner, the ideas proffered were the most basic. This is quite natural given the way in which ChatGPT works; it gives you the most common answer precisely because that’s what it’s been trained to do. What you won’t get, then, is the rare idea. No great loss if your goal is merely to complete an assignment for a grade, but clearly detrimental if you’re interested in actually learning something new.</p>
<p>For example, ChatGPT easily isolated the growth of administrative staff in higher ed as an important idea, since “administrative bloat” has been discussed widely in the media. But it did not consider the reason behind the increase, since this, in contrast, had not been widely discussed. In the article that I asked ChatGPT to summarize, the authors had pointed out that there was a rising standard of educational care that universities were required to meet, which another academic argued was the consequence of the “retreating state”. These were some of the most interesting ideas I learned from this exercise… and absolutely nowhere to be found with ChatGPT.</p>
<p><b>ChatGPT offers best results with expert knowledge</b></p>
<p>The chatbot works best when you already have a fairly clear idea of the answer. You must know enough to give it adequate direction. Superior direction gets superior results.</p>
<p>My takeaway? ChatGPT is a very useful tool. I can see myself using it to sketch out a basic outline, something to start with rather than starting with a blank page. But I am much too fond of the hard work of writing to give it up to the machine!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Okay, so maybe not the entire internet. As this <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2023/the-making-of-chatgpt-from-data-to-dialogue/">article</a> pointed out to me, ChatGPT’s creators <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf">used</a> “five datasets with diverse sources, including image captions (SNLI), transcribed speech, popular fiction, and government reports (MNLI), Wikipedia articles (QNLI), science exams (SciTail) or news articles (RTE).”</p>
