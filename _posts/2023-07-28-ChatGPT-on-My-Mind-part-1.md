<p>This spring it seemed like all anyone could talk about, write about and read about was ChatGPT. It’s not the first time that the media has lost its composure over what artificial intelligence can do. More than 20 years ago, coverage of IBM’s Deep Blue beating the Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov made the front pages of major newspapers. There were dramatic headlines and equall dramatic descriptions of defeat. The<a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1997/05/12/066265.html"> New York Times</a>, for example, reported that the computer had toppled Kasparov "in brisk and brutal fashion, unseating humanity," while the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/tech/analysis/kasparov/kasparov.htm">Washington Post</a>, reported that Kasparov, in "a stunning showdown between man and machine, proved no match for computer." A decade later, similarly excited reports appeared when Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat the South Korean world champion Go player Lee Sedol. Lee’s subsequent retirement from professional play in response to the AI’s invincibility was also widely covered in the news.</p>
<p>Yet, while those instances seemed to elicit a sense of wonder, the performance of ChatGPT provoked a deep sense of dread. One of the first pieces I read about ChatGPT was NYTimes tech columnist Kevin Roose’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html?smid=url-share">account</a> of his disturbing conversation with Microsoft Bing’s chatbot. Computers beating us at board games is one thing; computers beating us at conversation is something else entirely.</p>
<p>As a former translator, I know how the media enjoys telling the story about humans losing in the race against machines because it was a story often told about translation. That story was always an oversimplification; technology would never replace human translators. What it can do is change the work dramatically. The most successful translators combine their knowledge and expertise of both language and technology. This experience shapes my attitude towards ChatGPT, or at least my attitude as a worker. ChatGPT is simply a tool to be mastered. Of course, that leaves some mastering to do…</p>
