<p>When I wrote that I sought employment at Columbia University as <a href="https://mf3321.github.io/2023/06/16/Where-Ive-Been.html">“a place of achievement, new opportunities and ambitious goals,”</a> I didn’t necessarily mean for me, at least not at that moment. I meant other people. But something happens when you surround yourself in such an environment. Almost naturally, I started thinking about going back to school myself, especially since Columbia offers <a href="https://humanresources.columbia.edu/officers-tuition-exemption">great incentive</a> to do so. So many of my colleagues were taking advantage.
Certainly, there was the possibility of rejection. (Columbia staff aren’t guaranteed spots; we must apply and be accepted in the ordinary way.) And there was the possibility of failure. Above all, it would be hard work.</p>
<p>I decided I would try. Actually, I decided I <b>had</b> to try; I just could not pass up the opportunity. I chose to study data because, quite simply, data will hold the answer to everything we want to know. In the past, answers could be found through careful observation of the physical world. <i>Dimmi</i>, Leonardo da Vinci wrote alongside his drawings of man and machine. <i>Tell me</i>. Today, those same words invoke answers not from the observable, but from bytes of data. <i>Dimmi</i>, we now all ask. What does the data say? The importance of data has been made quite clear to me in my current role in the Dean’s Office of Columbia College. Decision making, planning, the very functioning of the College now demand data—lots of it and of every kind.</p>
<p>I was recommended Columbia’s <a href="https://www.qmss.columbia.edu/">Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences</a> (QMSS) program by our IT head at the time. The program had a strong reputation and many of my colleagues in DataGroup had graduated from or were enrolled in the program. Because I felt apprehensive about returning to the classroom after so many years, in anticipation of applying to the QMSS program, I reviewed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-calculus">calculus</a> with David Easdown, taught myself <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program">python programming</a> with Jennifer Campbell and Paul Gries, and the basics of <a href="https://j.bw.org/lil-sql">SQL</a> with Bill Weinmann. I also enrolled in the <a href="https://sps.columbia.edu/academics/postbaccalaureate-studies">School of Professional Studies postbaccalaureate program</a> and took an introductory undergraduate course <i>Statistical Thinking for Data Science</i> taught by Anthony Donoghue.</p>
<p>I was accepted and started the QMSS program in Fall 2022.</p>
